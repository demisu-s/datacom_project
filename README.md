Socket Programming in Python
Socket programming is a way of enabling communication between two or more devices over a network. In Python, the socket module provides a low-level interface for network communication using standard internet protocols such as TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol). This allows Python programs to establish connections, send and receive data, and handle network protocols.

Basic Concepts
Client-Server Model: A common paradigm in socket programming where the server listens for incoming client connections, and clients initiate communication with the server.
IP Address: The unique address of a device on a network.
Port Number: A numerical label that identifies a specific process or service on a machine.
Steps to Create a Socket
Create a socket: Use the socket module to create a socket object.
Bind to an address: For servers, bind the socket to an IP address and port number.
Listen for connections: Servers listen for incoming client connections.
Accept connection: Once a client connects, the server accepts the connection and communicates with the client.
Send/Receive data: Use the socket to send or receive data.
Close the connection: After communication is complete, close the socket.
